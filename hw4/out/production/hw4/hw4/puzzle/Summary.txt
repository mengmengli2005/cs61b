1. We have a word/number puzzle class whose helper methods can figure out the "distance" from current node to target node;
2. Create a "Solver" class:
    2.1 takes in the source stats (like a initial word) as the source node of the "Graph";
    2.2 uses a PriorityQueue to record and find the "best-first search" stats.
